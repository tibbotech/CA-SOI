Changelog of SOI Application

	- Date of Change : 04/18/2025
	- New revision of SOI Application : 4.40
	- Previous version of SOI Application : 4.38
	- Level of change : Major
	- Risk Assessment and Cons: Device in operation will need to be reconfigured due to change to the settings.
	- Depreciated Features : None

	- Reasons for change:
		-- Added new setting AR (allow reconnects) when under TCP mode. Default is enabled which will accept reconnect from the same IP, Disabled will not allow any reconnecton.
		-- Added new setting LS (Line State). RTS/CTS/DSR/DTR lines originally reported the electrical state (+=high / 0=low). The two options are: Standard (UART line state) and Reversed (Default value - electrical state).
		-- Added rts_mapping variable to conform to coding standard.
		-- Changed all Wifi start to be in active scanning mode so hidden SSID can still be connected to.
		-- Fixed the baudrate issue with Gen2 devices by removing speed lower than 1200bps.
		-- Added code to handle different stor.base value of different platforms. It was causing initialization issues.
		-- Cleaned up codes that reference to depreciated platforms (EM2000, EM500)

	- Files changed:
		-- boot.tbs : Added stor.base assignment. 
		-- device.tbh : new variable for LS (Line State)
		-- device.tbs : new variable for LS (Line State). Implement AR. Set limits for lower baudrate bounds for G2.
		-- dsman.tbh : changed version from ds4.38 to ds4.40
		-- dsman.tbs : allow for proper showing of LS based on mode. fixed baudrate showing issue in G2.
		-- dsman_1p.txt : Added AR and LS
		-- dsman_1p_em510.txt : Added AR and LS
		-- dsman_1p_ws110x.txt : Added AR and LS
		-- dsman_4p_4c.txt : Added AR and LS
		-- dsman_4p_4c_g2.txt : Added file for G2
		-- dsman_4p_4c_g3.txt : Added file for future G3 implementation
		-- global.tbh : Added notes on currently supported platforms. Cleaned up unsupported platforms. Extended max lines in DS Manager settings. Made sure all platforms were pointing to the right files.
		-- html_common.tbs : fixed baudrate and line state showing issues.
		-- html_config_ports.txt : Added LS
		-- html_config_ports.txt : Added file for G2
		-- html_config_ports_ws110x.txt : Added LS
		-- main.tbs : Fixed Line State related code.
		-- settings_1p.xtxt : Increased max settings and added new settings.
		-- settings_1p_em510.xtxt : Increased max settings and added new settings. Removed unused WK setting.
		-- settings_1p_ws110x.xtxt : Increased max settings and added new settings.
		-- settings_4p_4c.xtxt : Increased max settings and added new settings.
